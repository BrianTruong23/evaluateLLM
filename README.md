# Project: Fine-tune and Evaluate LLM Models on Popular Benchmark Datasets

## Overview

This project aims to evaluate various Large Language Models (LLMs) on popular benchmark datasets to identify their strengths and weaknesses. By utilizing benchmark datasets from previous research, we will implement and assess open-source LLMs, focusing on their performance across different tasks. Additionally, the project involves fine-tuning baseline models to enhance their accuracy and precision.

## Objectives

1. **Evaluation of LLMs**: Assess the performance of different LLMs on established benchmark datasets, identifying key strengths and weaknesses.
2. **Learning Evaluation Techniques**: Develop a deep understanding of evaluation methods to determine the effectiveness of newly created or fine-tuned models.
3. **Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune baseline models to improve their accuracy and precision, contributing to the development of more robust LLMs.

## Key Components

### 1. Benchmark Datasets

We will use benchmark datasets from previous research collaborations, such as those with Mishra, to provide a consistent and reliable basis for evaluation. These datasets are designed to test various aspects of LLM performance, including language understanding, generation, and specific task execution.

### 2. LLM Evaluation

- **Model Selection**: Choose a variety of open-source LLMs to evaluate. These might include models like GPT-3, BERT, RoBERTa, and others.
- **Performance Metrics**: Utilize metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and computational efficiency to assess model performance.
- **Analysis**: Conduct a thorough analysis to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model based on the evaluation metrics.

### 3. Fine-tuning Baseline Models

- **Baseline Models**: Start with well-known baseline models and fine-tune them on the selected benchmark datasets.
- **Fine-tuning Process**: Adjust hyperparameters, optimize training processes, and apply various fine-tuning techniques to enhance model performance.
- **Result Comparison**: Compare the fine-tuned models with their baseline versions to measure improvements in accuracy, precision, and other relevant metrics.

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Comprehensive Evaluation Report**: A detailed report highlighting the performance of various LLMs on the selected benchmark datasets, with a focus on their strengths and weaknesses.
2. **Improved Model Performance**: Enhanced versions of baseline models with better accuracy and precision, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning.
3. **Knowledge Gain**: A deeper understanding of LLM evaluation techniques and fine-tuning methods, contributing to the broader field of AI research.
